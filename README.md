## 🚀 Featured Projects

### MyTestBusinessCaseGenerator

**Description**: A smart web application that empowers presales professionals to rapidly generate customized, data-driven business cases. Simply input key parameters—location, transition period, productivity gains, cost savings, implementation timeline, and more—and get a professionally curated business case tailored to specific client contexts.

**What It Does**:
- Accepts structured business inputs (Location, Transition Period, Productivity Gains, Cost Reduction, Timeline, etc.)
- Generates AI-powered, context-aware business case narratives
- Produces ROI calculations and financial impact projections
- Exports ready-to-present business documents

**Why It Matters**: Presales teams spend countless hours building business cases from scratch. This tool reduces that time from hours to minutes, enabling teams to focus on client strategy rather than document creation.
